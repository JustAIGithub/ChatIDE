## Known issues

1. There's currently no way to stop the model from generating. You need to wait until it's done.
2. Closing the ChatIDE pane while the model is generating will lead to a non-recoverable error. You'll need to restart VS Code to use ChatIDE again.
3. Closing / re-opening the ChatIDE pane does not reset the messages history. You can reset the message history by clicking the "Reset Chat" button (don't do this while the model is generating!)

## Warning

This is an early prototype, use at your own peril.
